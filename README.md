Hello Guys, hope you enwjoy this simple task that i manage to make for a task probeI hope you find it challenging yet fun to complete. Let's see how well you can do!

So i made this simple codes webside to catch and demostrate some easy to pull request and offer a probe of my web develop skills, i know that is basic, but i can make it really better too.

So here goes some explanation of how to understand the code, and how it works.

In adittional your going to see that i can go even better, that's what i'll do in a non so distant future.I am constantly learning and improving my skills to provide better and more advanced solutions. Stay tuned for more updates and improvements in the future. Let's keep coding and pushing the boundaries together!

So for the very beginning: HTML
Starts an HTML file that defines the structure and content of a webpage. It includes the basic HTML elements such as <html>, <head>, and <body>. The code also includes CSS styles and JavaScript code that control the appearance and behavior of the webpage.

The first 86 lines of the code define the structure of the webpage by specifying the HTML elements, their attributes, and their relationships with each other. For example, the <header> element contains the navigation menu, which is defined by the <nav> element. The <nav> element contains a list of links, which is defined by the <ul> element.

The remaining lines of the code include JavaScript code that is used to track user interactions with the webpage and to load additional scripts and styles. The window.onload function is called when the webpage is loaded, and it calls the getFullUrl function to get the full URL of the current page, and then calls the trackPageView function to track the page view. The assets/Iex/MyprojectAgency.ex and assets/js/index.js files contain the Exscript and JavaScript code, respectively, that are used to implement various features of the webpage.

Next going for the exlixir module:
def elixir do
  quote do
    import Elixir.Kernel, except: [def: 2]
    import Elixir.Macro, except: [defmacro: 2]
    import Elixir.Module, except: [defmodule: 2]
    import Elixir.Protocol, except: [defprotocol: 2]
    import Elixir.String, except: [to_atom: 1]
    import Elixir.System, except: [get_env: 1]
    import Elixir.Task, except: [async: 1, await: 1]
    import Elixir.Tuple, except: [to_list: 1]

    defmacro __using__(_opts) do
      quote do
        import unquote(__MODULE__)
      end
    end
  end
end

The selected code is part of a function called elixir that is used to generate a code snippet for the TabNine code completion engine. The function defines a series of imports for various Elixir modules, including Elixir.Kernel, Elixir.Macro, Elixir.Module, Elixir.Protocol, Elixir.String, Elixir.System, Elixir.Task, and Elixir.Tuple.

The code also includes a call to defmacro __using__(_opts), which is a special function used to define a macro that is automatically imported into the module where it is defined. In this case, the macro is used to import the contents of the current module (unquote(MODULE)) into the importing module.
